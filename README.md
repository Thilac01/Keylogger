# Python Keylogger with Server-Client Communication  

This project implements a **keylogger** that captures keyboard inputs on a client machine and sends the logged data to a server for centralized monitoring.  

---

## 📋 Features  

- Captures keyboard input on the client machine.  
- Sends logged data to the server via a socket connection.  
- Stores received logs on the server for analysis.  
- Easy to set up and customize.  

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  

- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**: Dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`.  

---

## 📂 Project Structure  

- `server.py`: Python script to act as the server and receive logs.  
- `client.py`: Python script to capture keystrokes and send them to the server.  
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the dependencies required for the project.
